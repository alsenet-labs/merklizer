# README

The actual demo is hashing files using SHA512-256, building a Merkle
tree from those hashes and anchoring the Merkle root directly to
the Ethereum blockchain (using the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/)).

After the blockchain transaction appears on the blockchain, it allows
you to download a zip archive containing all the Merkle proofs and the
anchoring details, one json per input file.

Files are NOT transmitted to the server, everything occurs client-side.

Provisions are made to allow anchoring data on other blockchains.

## Quickstart
