      <p>The file "{{::file.name}}" looks genuine.</p>
      <p>The following facts have been established conclusively:<p>
      <p>The file hash match the {{::file.proof.hashType}} hash stored in the proof ({{::file.proof.hash}})</p>
      <p>The Merkle root ({{::file.proof.root}}) has been recomputed sucessfuly from the file hash after the following operations:</p>
      <pre>
        {{ ::file.proof.operations }}
      </pre>
      <p>Finally the Merkle root has been retrieved in the transactions mentioned and listed below:</p>
      <div class="anchor" ng-repeat="anchor in file.proof.anchors">
        <div anchor="anchor"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>You should now verify that the account numbers are indeed owned by the competent authority.</p>
    <pre> {{ file.proof | stringify }} </pre>
